These are the config files DejaGnu uses to access the Linaro build
farm. When the DEJAGNU environment variables is set to
abe/config/linaro.exp, then abe/config/boards is prefixed to
the directory lookup paths. The top level sub directory is the shorter
nodename of the system's hostname, for example tcwgbuild01.

In each of these sub directories, are the baseboard files used to tell
the testing framework how to access the target platform. Currently all
of our targets we can SSH to, which makes these files very simple. All
each file has to do is specify the hostname of the target. All the
real work is handled by the 'arm-linux' baseboard support in DejaGnu.

If you want to use your local build farm, then create the hostname
directory (ie... 'myfoo`), and in the 'myfoo' sub directory, change
the hostname in the appropriate config file. If you want to create a
new target, just copy 'arm-chromebook', and edit the hostname
setting. Ports are specified in the hostname setting using ':' and
then the port number. To change which targets DejaGnu tries to use,
edit the 'config/linaro.exp', and change the target_list. The names in
the target list are used to lookup the proper board file, so if the
'barfood' target is in the list 'set target_list { barfood }', then
the board file 'config/board/$nodename/barfoo.exp' is used to get the
hostname of the target.

Current build machines in the Linaro build farm are:
x86_64: tcwgbuild01-tcwgbuild06
i686: tcwgbuild01-tcwgbuild06 (in a chroot)

SSH access to these machines from outside the TCWG subnet is:
validation.linaro.org port ports 41001-41006

Chromebooks:
armv7: tcwgchromebook01-tcwgchromebook06

SSH access to these chromebooks from outside the TCWG subnet is:
validation.linaro.org port ports 40001-40006

You need to have a valid Linaro account to have SSH access to these
machines.
